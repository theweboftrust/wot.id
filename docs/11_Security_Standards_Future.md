# 11: Security, Standards, and Future Roadmap

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the security posture, key standards, development practices, and strategic roadmap for the wot.id project. It begins with a formal threat model and security considerations, then details the standards ensuring interoperability, the principles guiding implementation, and the planned evolution of the ecosystem.

## 2. Threats and Security

A robust security architecture is foundational to wot.id, directly supporting its core principles of user sovereignty and trust. The following outlines key threats and the corresponding mitigation strategies.

### 2.1. Threat Model

The threat model considers various actors and attack vectors:

*   **Malicious Actors on the Network**: Entities attempting to compromise the system through on-chain or off-chain attacks.
    *   **On-Chain Attacks**: Exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities, manipulating governance, Sybil attacks.
    *   **Off-Chain Attacks**: Intercepting P2P communication, social engineering, compromising user devices or backend infrastructure.
*   **Malicious Insiders**: A compromised backend service or a rogue developer introducing vulnerabilities.
*   **Compromised User Devices**: Attackers gaining control of a user's device to steal private keys or manipulate the user's agent.
*   **Quantum Adversaries**: Future actors with access to quantum computers capable of breaking classical cryptography.

### 2.2. Security Mitigations and Best Practices

*   **Smart Contract Security (Move)**:
    *   **Leveraging Move's Safety**: Utilizing Move's resource safety, type system, and ownership model to prevent common vulnerabilities like re-entrancy, integer overflows, and unauthorized resource access.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Implementing the capabilities pattern (`AdminCap`, `MintCap`, etc.) to ensure functions can only be called by authorized entities.
    *   **Audits and Formal Verification**: Critical smart contracts, especially those managing identity, assets, and governance, are targeted for formal security audits and, where feasible, formal verification to mathematically prove their correctness.
*   **P2P Communication Security**:
    *   **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: All P2P communication is secured using the Signal Protocol, providing forward secrecy and post-quantum resistance (via PQXDH).
    *   **VC-Gated Handshakes**: Requiring peers to present a "Verified Human" VC before establishing a communication channel mitigates spam and unsolicited contact.
*   **Backend and API Security**:
    *   **Input Validation**: Rigorous validation of all data received from clients or external systems to prevent injection attacks and malformed data processing.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization**: Protecting API endpoints with robust authentication mechanisms and ensuring requests are properly authorized.
    *   **Secure Infrastructure**: Following best practices for secure deployment, including network segmentation, firewalls, and regular security patching.
*   **Frontend and User Security**:
    *   **No Private Key Handling**: The frontend **never** handles or stores user private keys. All cryptographic signing operations are delegated to the user's wallet extension (via `@iota/dapp-kit`), which runs in a sandboxed environment.
    *   **Secure Dependencies**: Regularly auditing and updating frontend dependencies to mitigate supply chain attacks.
*   **Data Storage Security**:
    *   **Off-Chain Encryption**: Users or applications are responsible for encrypting sensitive data *before* storing it in off-chain systems like IPFS.
    *   **On-Chain Integrity**: On-chain records store only cryptographic hashes or content identifiers (CIDs) of off-chain data, ensuring its integrity and verifiability.
*   **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Readiness**:
    *   **Crypto-Agility**: The system is designed to be crypto-agile, allowing for the transition to new cryptographic algorithms as standards evolve.
    *   **Hybrid Approach**: Employing a hybrid strategy where PQC algorithms (CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Kyber) are used for off-chain security (E2EE, VC signatures), while relying on IOTA Move VM-supported classical schemes (Ed25519) for on-chain authentication until on-chain PQC verification is available. This is a critical security consideration detailed in `docs/07_Trust_Architecture_And_Management.md`.

## 3. Adopted Standards

wot.id is committed to leveraging established and emerging standards to foster interoperability and build upon a globally recognized foundation. Key adopted standards include:

*   **W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Core to the wot.id identity model. Users are identified by DIDs, specifically `did:iota:<object-id>`, ensuring a decentralized and universally resolvable identifier system. This is consistently referenced across architecture documents, including `docs/01_Project_Overview_And_Principles.md` (Principle 3.2.9: IOTA-Native and W3C-Compliant).
*   **W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**: The structure and concepts of Verifiable Credentials are foundational for issuing, holding, and verifying claims within wot.id. The Move contract architecture (e.g., `Credential` and `Proof` objects as detailed in `docs/05_Move_Smart_Contracts.md`) reflects this alignment, enabling standardized, interoperable attestations of information.
*   **IOTA Standards and Practices**: As an IOTA-native project, wot.id adheres to the standards, protocols, and best practices of the IOTA ecosystem, particularly concerning the use of the IOTA Tangle, IOTA Layer 2, Move smart contracts, and Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs).
*   **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Standards (NIST)**: wot.id aims for crypto-agility and future-proof security by preparing for and integrating NIST-standardized PQC algorithms (e.g., CRYSTALS-Dilithium, CRYSTALS-Kyber) for digital signatures and key exchange mechanisms, as detailed in `docs/06_P2P_Communication.md` and Technical Design Principle #7.

## 4. Interoperability Strategy

Achieving seamless interoperability within the broader digital trust ecosystem is a primary objective for wot.id. The strategy to achieve this includes:

*   **Alignment with Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation**: wot.id demonstrates strong philosophical and technical alignment with the ToIP model (`docs/01_Project_Overview_And_Principles.md`). This includes:
    *   Embracing the dual-stack model (Technology + Governance).
    *   Mapping to ToIP's four-layer architecture (Support, Spanning, Tasks, Applications).
    *   Committing to the development of a formal `wot.id` Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP) to solidify Layer 2 interoperability, as highlighted in `docs/01_Project_Overview_And_Principles.md`.
*   **Semantic Interoperability**: The planned `ContextRegistry` and the consistent use of URI-based context identifiers in various data structures (e.g., `TrustRelationship`, `ClaimTrust`) are designed to promote clear, unambiguous meaning and semantic interoperability across different systems and applications.
*   **Modular Design**: The architecture's modularity, with clear separation of concerns (e.g., `identity`, `credentials`, `governance` modules in Move), facilitates easier integration with other ToIP-compliant systems and components.
*   **Standardized Data Formats**: Adherence to W3C VC data models and other relevant standards ensures that data exchanged by wot.id can be understood and processed by other compliant systems.

## 5. Development Principles and Best Practices

The development of wot.id is guided by a set of core principles and best practices to ensure a high-quality, secure, and maintainable system:

*   **Core Software Engineering Principles**:
    *   **Modularity and Composability**: Designing components that are independent, reusable, and can be combined to build complex functionalities (Ref: Technical Design Principle #6: Atomic Data Structure & Modularity).
    *   **Readability and Maintainability**: Writing clear, well-documented code that is easy to understand, modify, and debug.
    *   **Testability**: Ensuring code is structured to facilitate comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
    *   **Scalability and Performance**: Designing the system to handle growth in users and data efficiently (aligns with Technical Design Principle #3: Real-Time, Low-Cost Transactions).
    *   **Reusability**: Creating components and libraries that can be leveraged across different parts of the system or in future projects.
    *   **Clean UI Asset Management**: When incorporating or migrating UI assets (e.g., CSS/SCSS from previous project iterations or external sources), a "clean slate" approach is mandatory. This involves:
        *   Identifying and migrating only atomic, modular UI fragments (e.g., specific CSS/SCSS files or components).
        *   Manually reviewing each asset to ensure no legacy selectors, outdated dependencies, or non-compliant logic is carried forward.
        *   Strictly prohibiting the porting of legacy JavaScript/TypeScript logic, or remnants from unrelated technology stacks (e.g., EVM, AppKit, Ceramic), unless it is 100% compliant with current wot.id principles and thoroughly reviewed.
        *   Utilizing linters and static analysis tools to verify that migrated or new frontend assets do not contain legacy imports or deprecated patterns.
        *   Documenting the rationale and source for any migrated UI assets, potentially within a dedicated `styles/README.md` or equivalent.
*   **Security and Privacy by Design**: Integrating security and privacy considerations into every stage of the development lifecycle, from architecture design to implementation and deployment (Ref: Technical Design Principle #5). This includes threat modeling, secure coding practices, and data minimization.
*   **User-Centricity**: Prioritizing the needs and experience of the end-user in all design and development decisions, aiming for intuitive and empowering interactions (Ref: `docs/08_Frontend_And_User_Experience.md`).
*   **Comprehensive Testing**: Implementing a robust testing strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and security testing to ensure reliability and correctness.
*   **Thorough Documentation**: Maintaining up-to-date and comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the system, including architecture, APIs, and user guides.
*   **Tech Stack Specific Practices**:
    *   **Move**: Adhering to idiomatic Move development patterns, leveraging Move's resource safety features, and aiming for formal verification of critical smart contracts where feasible (as detailed in `docs/05_Move_Smart_Contracts.md`).
    *   **Rust**: Utilizing idiomatic Rust, focusing on safety through ownership and borrowing, robust error handling, and performance optimization where necessary (as detailed in `docs/04_Backend_And_Identity_Service.md`).
    *   **Next.js**: Employing component-based architecture, effective state management strategies, and leveraging Next.js features like Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) for optimal performance and UX (Ref: `docs/08_Frontend_And_User_Experience.md`).

## 6. Technical Design Principles Enforcement

The wot.id project actively enforces its core Technical Design Principles throughout its lifecycle:

1.  **Modularity and Composability**: Achieved through microservices (e.g., Identity Service), distinct Move modules, and a component-based frontend.
2.  **Security and Privacy by Design**: Implemented via E2EE, PQC considerations, secure key management, input validation, and privacy-preserving techniques where applicable.
3.  **Decentralization and User Sovereignty**: Core to the architecture, with users controlling their DIDs, data, and participation in governance.
4.  **Interoperability and Standardization**: Pursued through adherence to W3C DIDs/VCs, ToIP alignment, and a planned Trust Spanning Protocol.
5.  **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**: Addressed via robust error handling, process isolation (e.g., Identity Service), and design for distributed systems.
6.  **Rigorous Testing and Validation**: Enforced through a multi-layered testing strategy and planned security audits.
7.  **Crypto-Agility and Future-Proofing**: Addressed by planning for PQC algorithm transitions and designing for adaptable cryptographic components.
8.  **Simplicity and Clarity**: Striving for understandable code, clear APIs, and well-defined system boundaries.
9.  **Comprehensive Documentation**: Evidenced by the ongoing effort to create a definitive set of documentation in the `docs/` directory.
10. **Performance and Scalability**: Considered in choices of technology (Rust, IOTA L2) and architectural patterns.
11. **Ethical Considerations and Responsible Innovation**: Guiding decisions on data handling, algorithmic bias, and the potential impact of the technology, as detailed in `docs/07_Trust_Architecture_And_Management.md` (Section 8).
