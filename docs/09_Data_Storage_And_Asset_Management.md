# 09: Data Storage and Asset Management

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the wot.id project's comprehensive strategy for data storage and digital asset management. The approach is designed to be secure, decentralized, and user-centric, aligning with the core principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and absolute user control. It emphasizes a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of the IOTA Tangle for on-chain records and decentralized off-chain solutions for larger data payloads.

## 2. Core Principles for Data and Asset Management

The management of data and digital assets within wot.id is guided by several foundational technical design principles:

*   **Hybrid Data Storage Strategy**: `wot.id` employs a hybrid approach. The IOTA Tangle is used for immutable, auditable records of transactions, proofs, essential metadata, and pointers to larger data. Complementary off-chain storage solutions are utilized for data blobs, documents, and other voluminous assets. (As per Technical Design Principle #3, `docs/01_Project_Overview_And_Principles.md`)
*   **Atomic Data Structure**: Data, including identity attributes and asset components, is structured as atomic, independently manageable fragments. This enhances modularity, auditability, user control, and allows for selective disclosure and recomposition as needed. (As per Technical Design Principle #6 and `docs/01_Project_Overview_And_Principles.md`)
*   **Security and Privacy by Design**: Security and privacy are integral to the storage architecture. This includes robust encryption, access control mechanisms, and data minimization practices. (As per Technical Design Principle #5, `docs/01_Project_Overview_And_Principles.md`)
*   **User Control and Sovereignty**: Users maintain absolute control and ownership over their data and digital assets, deciding what is stored, how it is shared, and with whom.

## 3. On-Chain Storage (IOTA L2 with Move)

The IOTA Layer 2, with its Move smart contract capabilities, forms the backbone of on-chain data and asset management.

*   **Role of the Tangle**:
    *   Stores core transactional data related to asset creation, transfer, and modification.
    *   Anchors cryptographic proofs, attestations, and essential metadata.
    *   Holds secure references (e.g., hashes, unique identifiers) to data stored off-chain.
*   **Move Smart Contracts for Asset Representation**:
    *   Digital assets can be represented as distinct Move objects (structs with `key` and `store` abilities), defining their properties and ownership.
    *   Logic for asset lifecycle management (creation, transfer, burning) is embedded within these smart contracts.
*   **Utilizing Dynamic Fields for Collections**:
    *   The IOTA Move framework provides [`iota::dynamic_field`](https://docs.iota.org/smart-contracts/guide/core_concepts/data_model#dynamic-fields) (for non-object data) and [`iota::dynamic_object_field`](https://docs.iota.org/smart-contracts/guide/core_concepts/data_model#dynamic-fields) (for objects). (An example of `iota::dynamic_object_field` usage, where `MessageObject`s are stored, can be seen with the `MailboxObject` in `docs/06_P2P_Communication.md`. These dynamic fields are a standard feature of the IOTA Move framework, detailed in the official [IOTA Smart Contracts Data Model documentation](https://docs.iota.org/smart-contracts/guide/core_concepts/data_model#dynamic-fields).)
    *   These dynamic fields allow a parent Move object to manage a flexible collection of child data or object references. This is crucial for scenarios like a user's wallet holding multiple asset tokens or a registry managing pointers to various data objects.

## 4. Off-Chain Storage Strategy

For data that is too large or unsuitable for direct on-chain storage, `wot.id` utilizes an off-chain strategy.

*   **Purpose**: To store larger data payloads such as documents, images, videos, complex datasets, or other rich media associated with on-chain assets, identities, or attestations.
*   **Mechanism**:
    *   On-chain records (e.g., within a Move object representing an asset) will contain a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) or a content-addressable identifier (e.g., an IPFS CID) that securely links to the actual data stored off-chain.
    *   This ensures the integrity and verifiability of the off-chain data without cluttering the ledger. (Aligning with the principles for off-chain evidence discussed in `docs/07_Trust_Architecture_And_Management.md`).
*   **Candidate Technologies**: Decentralized storage networks like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) are strong candidates, aligning with `wot.id`'s decentralized ethos. Such systems provide content addressing, resilience, and censorship resistance.
*   **Access Control and Encryption**:
    *   The responsibility for securing off-chain data (e.g., through encryption before upload) lies with the user or the applications facilitating the storage.
    *   Access control mechanisms can be implemented by encrypting the data with keys managed by the owner or shared selectively with authorized parties.

## 5. Digital Asset Management

## 5. Digital Asset Management in wot.id

`wot.id` aims to be a versatile platform for the secure creation, management, storage, and peer-to-peer transfer of a wide spectrum of digital and digitized assets. This vision encompasses everything from custom cryptocurrencies and utility tokens to unique digital collectibles (NFTs), representations of real-world assets (RWAs), and in-game items. The platform leverages the IOTA L2, with its robust Move smart contract capabilities, to provide a flexible and secure environment for diverse asset types.

### 5.1. Core Technologies and Standards

The foundation for asset management within `wot.id` relies on:

*   **IOTA L2 Move Smart Contracts**: All asset logic, including definition, ownership, and transfer rules, is implemented using Move smart contracts, benefiting from Move's safety and expressiveness.
*   **Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs)**: All on-chain asset operations (creation, transfer, updates, burning) are executed atomically within PTBs, ensuring consistency and preventing partial state changes.
*   **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: User DIDs (as detailed in `docs/04_Backend_And_Identity_Service.md` and `docs/05_Move_Smart_Contracts.md`) are central to asset ownership, providing a secure and self-sovereign anchor for controlling digital property.
*   **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**: VCs can be used to attest to asset properties, provenance, or associated rights, enhancing trust and enabling complex interactions (see `docs/07_Trust_Architecture_And_Management.md`).

### 5.2. Fungible Assets (Tokens)

`wot.id` supports various types of fungible tokens through standardized IOTA Move modules:

*   **IOTA Coin Standard ([`iota::coin`](https://docs.iota.org/smart-contracts/guide/token_standards/iota_coin))**:
    *   **Purpose**: This module provides an ERC-20 equivalent standard for creating general-purpose fungible tokens on the IOTA L2.
    *   **Capabilities**: It supports core functionalities such as defining a token (name, symbol, decimals), minting new tokens, burning existing tokens, transferring tokens between addresses or objects, and querying balances.
    *   **Use Cases**: Custom cryptocurrencies, utility tokens for accessing platform services, governance tokens for DAOs, community currencies, and more.
*   **Regulated and Specialized Tokens**:
    *   **`CoinManager` Standard**: For tokens requiring more sophisticated supply management or metadata controls, the `CoinManager` standard offers enhanced functionalities.
    *   **Closed-Loop Token Standard ([`iota::token`](https://docs.iota.org/smart-contracts/guide/token_standards/closed_loop_token))**: This standard is designed for tokens with restricted functionalities, where actions like transfers or conversions are subject to specific policies defined within the smart contract. This is ideal for loyalty points, in-game currencies that should not leave the game ecosystem, or other specific-purpose tokens.
*   **Bridged Assets**: While requiring further specific implementation for cross-chain communication and security, the `wot.id` architecture, combined with IOTA's interoperability features, can be extended to represent and manage assets bridged from other blockchain networks. This would involve locking assets on one chain and minting corresponding "wrapped" tokens on the IOTA L2.

### 5.3. Non-Fungible Assets (NFTs)

`wot.id` provides robust support for Non-Fungible Tokens, allowing for unique digital asset representation:

*   **Custom NFT Implementation**: NFTs are typically defined as custom Move structs possessing the `key` and `store` abilities. Each NFT object has a unique `id: UID` and can include various fields for attributes and metadata.
*   **Metadata Management**:
    *   On-chain metadata is usually minimal (e.g., name, symbol, a URI).
    *   Rich metadata (images, videos, detailed descriptions, attributes) is stored off-chain, typically on decentralized storage like IPFS (as discussed in Section 4). The on-chain NFT contains an immutable link (e.g., IPFS CID in the `url` field) to this off-chain data, ensuring verifiability.
*   **Use Cases**:
    *   Digital art and collectibles.
    *   Certificates of authenticity or ownership.
    *   Licenses and intellectual property rights.
    *   Unique identifiers for tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs).
    *   In-game items with unique properties.
*   **IOTA NFT Standards (e.g., IRC27)**: While IRC27 primarily defines L1 native NFTs, its principles (like collection identity and metadata structure) can inspire and guide the design of L2 Move-based NFT implementations for consistency and interoperability within the broader IOTA ecosystem.

### 5.4. Representing Real-World Assets (RWAs)

`wot.id` can facilitate the tokenization of Real-World Assets, bridging the gap between physical/traditional assets and the digital realm:

*   **Tokenization Model**: RWAs can be represented as NFTs (for unique assets like real estate or art) or potentially as fungible tokens (for fractional ownership of an asset). The specific Move contract will define the link to the RWA and the rights of the token holder.
*   **Role of Verifiable Credentials**: VCs play a crucial role in RWA tokenization by providing verifiable attestations about the asset's existence, condition, provenance, legal ownership, and compliance with regulations. These VCs can be issued by trusted third parties (custodians, legal entities, auditors).
*   **Oracles and Legal Integration**: Secure integration with oracles may be necessary to bring external data about RWAs (e.g., market prices, status updates) on-chain. Furthermore, the legal enforceability of RWA token rights depends on the underlying legal frameworks, which must be considered in the design.

### 5.5. Gaming Assets

The platform is well-suited for managing diverse in-game assets:

*   **Unique Items as NFTs**: Weapons, armor, characters, land plots, and other unique in-game items can be represented as NFTs, giving players true ownership and the ability to trade them securely.
*   **In-Game Currencies**: Fungible tokens, created using `iota::coin` (for open economies) or `iota::token` (for closed-loop game economies), can serve as in-game currency.
*   **Interoperability**: While game-specific, `wot.id`'s common infrastructure can foster interoperability of assets across different games or metaverses built on or integrated with the platform, if desired by game developers.

### 5.6. Asset Lifecycle Management (Common Operations)

Regardless of the asset type, common lifecycle operations are managed through Move smart contracts and PTBs:

*   **Creation (Minting)**: Assets are brought into existence by invoking specific functions (e.g., `mint`, `create`) on their respective Move contracts. This can be controlled by authorized minters or follow predefined rules.
*   **Ownership and Control**: Ownership is typically tied to a user's DID or a Move object they control (like a Kiosk). Advanced ownership models like multi-signature control or contract-based ownership (e.g., for DAOs) are possible.
*   **Transfer**: Peer-to-peer transfers are executed via PTBs. This can involve calling the standard `iota::transfer::public_transfer` function for objects with `store` or custom transfer functions defined in the asset's contract to enforce specific rules (e.g., royalties, transfer restrictions).
*   **Updates/Modification**: For assets with mutable properties or metadata, dedicated contract functions allow authorized updates.
*   **Burning**: Assets can be permanently removed from circulation by invoking burn functions, which destroy the asset object.

### 5.7. Advanced Asset Interactions with the IOTA Kiosk Pattern

To provide a richer user experience for managing a diverse portfolio of assets, `wot.id` can leverage the **[IOTA Kiosk](https://docs.iota.org/smart-contracts/guide/token_standards/kiosk)** standard:

*   **Concept**: A Kiosk is a user-owned Move object that acts as a personal, on-chain "shop" or "vault." It can securely hold various types of assets (both fungible tokens and NFTs) owned by the user.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   **Aggregated Asset Management**: Users can see and manage all their different assets through their Kiosk.
    *   **Direct Sales & Trading**: Kiosks can facilitate peer-to-peer sales of assets. A user can list an asset for sale in their Kiosk, and another user can purchase it directly by interacting with the Kiosk contract.
    *   **Offers and Auctions**: The Kiosk pattern can be extended (often via Kiosk Apps) to support offer systems, auctions, or other sophisticated trading mechanisms.
    *   **Lending/Borrowing (Potential)**: With appropriate Kiosk App extensions, assets held in a Kiosk could potentially be used in lending or collateralization protocols.
*   **Extensibility with Kiosk Apps**: The IOTA Kiosk standard allows for "Kiosk Apps," which are separate Move modules that can extend the functionality of a Kiosk without modifying its core code or moving the assets. This enables features like custom marketplaces, royalty enforcements, or unique trading rules.

By integrating the Kiosk pattern, `wot.id` can offer users a powerful and unified interface for interacting with the full spectrum of their digital assets.

### 5.8. Security and Access Control for Assets

Security is paramount in asset management:

*   **Move's Safety Features**: The Move language's strong type system, ownership model, and resource safety prevent many common smart contract vulnerabilities.
*   **Capability-Based Access**: Contract functions are often protected using the capability pattern, ensuring that only entities holding the correct "capability" object (e.g., an `AdminCap`, `MintCap`) can perform sensitive operations.
*   **DID and VC Integration**: DIDs secure ownership, and VCs can be used to gate access to certain asset operations or prove eligibility for specific interactions.

## 6. Data Fragmentation and Recomposition

Consistent with the "Atomic Data Structure" principle:

*   Digital assets and associated data can be composed of smaller, independent fragments.
*   For example, a complex digital asset might have its core definition on-chain, while associated media or detailed documentation is stored off-chain as separate fragments, linked via identifiers.
*   Users can selectively disclose or share specific fragments of their assets or data, enhancing privacy and control.

## 7. Security and Privacy Considerations for Storage

*   **Data Minimization**: Only essential data required for the functioning and verification of assets and transactions is stored on-chain. Sensitive details are kept off-chain or managed through privacy-preserving techniques.
*   **Encryption**:
    *   **Off-Chain Data**: Strong encryption should be applied to sensitive off-chain data before it is stored, with users managing their encryption keys.
    *   **On-Chain Data**: While on-chain data is public, sensitive elements within on-chain structs could potentially be encrypted if the use case demands and Move's capabilities allow for practical on-chain decryption or zero-knowledge proofs for verification. (ZKPs mentioned in `docs/07_Trust_Architecture_And_Management.md`)
*   **Integrity and Verifiability**: Cryptographic hashes stored on-chain ensure the integrity of off-chain data. Any tampering with off-chain data would result in a hash mismatch.
*   **Access Control**: Robust access control mechanisms must be implemented for both on-chain contract interactions (e.g., using Move's capabilities pattern) and off-chain data stores.

## 8. Future Considerations

*   Exploration of advanced privacy-preserving storage techniques.
*   Integration with emerging decentralized storage networks and protocols.
