# 99: Move Smart Contracts Code Review

**Date of Review**: 2025-06-10
**Reviewer**: Cascade (AI Assistant)
**Scope**: Review of Move smart contract source code located in `/Users/axelnoack/CascadeProjects/wot.id/move-contracts/sources/` comprising `identity.move`, `credentials.move`, and `trust.move`.

## 1. Introduction

This document presents a code review of the wot.id project's Move smart contracts. The review focuses on correctness, security, adherence to documented principles, and completeness based on the provided source code. It identifies critical issues, areas for improvement, and positive aspects of the implementation.

## 2. Overall Assessment of Move Contracts

The Move smart contracts for wot.id (`identity`, `credentials`, `trust`) exhibit a sophisticated design that aligns well with the project's ambitious goals for decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, and advanced trust management. The data structures are generally well-defined and comprehensive, reflecting the principles outlined in the project documentation.

However, the review has identified several **critical issues**, primarily related to **missing authorization checks** in key functions and the presence of **non-functional placeholder code** for essential operations (e.g., DID generation helpers, direct trust queries). These issues currently render significant parts of the on-chain logic incomplete or insecure.

Addressing these critical items is paramount for the contracts to function correctly and securely as intended.

## 3. General Recommendations Across Modules

1.  **Implement All Placeholder Functions**: Critical helper functions (e.g., `object_id_to_hex` in `identity.move`, `get_direct_trust` in `trust.move`, `create_nonce` in `credentials.move`) must be fully and correctly implemented.
2.  **Consistent Authorization Checks**: Ensure that all `entry` functions performing sensitive operations or acting on behalf of an identity robustly verify that `tx_context::sender(ctx)` is an authorized controller of the relevant `Identity` object (using `identity::is_controller`).
3.  **Robust String and Data Conversions**: Replace simplified string conversion utilities with production-ready implementations if precise on-chain string formatting is required. Ensure vector lengths are validated when constructing complex objects from multiple input vectors.
4.  **Review `TrustRelationship` Duplication**: Consolidate the `TrustRelationship` definition, likely by removing the simpler version in `credentials.move` and ensuring all trust logic uses the canonical version in `trust.move`.
5.  **Testing**: Rigorous testing, including scenarios that target authorization bypasses and edge cases in placeholder functions, will be crucial once these issues are addressed.

## 4. Module-Specific Review

### 4.1. `identity.move`

*   **Purpose**: Manages decentralized digital identities (DIDs), including controllers, verification methods, and privacy settings.
*   **Positive Aspects**:
    *   **Correct Authorization Checks**: All existing entry functions that modify state (`add_verification_method`, `add_controller`, `update_privacy_settings`) correctly verify that the sender is a controller.
    *   **Functional Helpers**: The `object_id_to_hex` function is fully implemented, not a placeholder.
    *   The `Identity` struct is well-defined and aligns with DID principles.
    *   `PrivacySettings` struct shows good foresight for privacy-by-design.
*   **Critical Issues & Improvements**:
    1.  **CRITICAL - Missing Functionality**: The `remove_controller` and `remove_verification_method` functions are not implemented. These are essential for managing an identity's lifecycle.
    2.  **CRITICAL - Controller Management**: When implementing `remove_controller`, the logic **must prevent** the removal of the last controller to avoid orphaning the identity and making it unmanageable.
    3.  **Manage `AttributePolicy`**: No functions to manage `attribute_policies` within `PrivacySettings`. Implement if granular control is needed.
    4.  **`VerificationMethod` Purposes**: Clarify how `purposes: vector<u8>` maps to specific verification purposes. Consider more descriptive types or constants.

### 4.2. `credentials.move`

*   **Purpose**: Manages Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and a version of Trust Relationships.
*   **Positive Aspects**:
    *   **Correct Authorization Checks**: Both `issue_credential` and `create_trust_relationship` correctly verify that the transaction sender is a controller of the relevant identity, which is a critical security measure.
    *   Structs (`Credential`, `Claim`, `Proof`, `Evidence`) align well with W3C VC standards.
    *   Logical flow for `issue_credential` and `create_trust_relationship` (the latter likely to be superseded by `trust.move`).
    *   Correct use of `Option` for expiration dates.
*   **Critical Issues & Improvements**:
    1.  **CRITICAL - `TrustRelationship` Struct Duplication**: This module contains a `TrustRelationship` struct that is less detailed than the one in `trust.move`. It should be deprecated and removed to avoid confusion and ensure the canonical `trust.move::TrustRelationship` is used as the single source of truth.
    2.  **CRITICAL - Dependency on Placeholder `object_id_to_hex`**: Credential ID generation will be incorrect if `identity.move::object_id_to_hex` is not fixed.
    3.  **CRITICAL - Unseen `create_nonce` Implementation**: The security of `Proof` depends on a robust `create_nonce` function. **Its implementation needs review and validation.**
    4.  **Claim Construction Robustness**: Add assertions to ensure `claim_names`, `claim_values`, and `claim_types` vectors have equal lengths in `issue_credential`.
    5.  **Evidence Handling**: Clarify if `create_trust_relationship` should support multiple pieces of evidence at creation.

### 4.3. `trust.move`

*   **Purpose**: Implements the core trust architecture, including entity-to-entity trust (`TrustRelationship`) and claim-level trust (`ClaimTrust`).
*   **Positive Aspects**:
    *   Comprehensive and detailed structs (`TrustLevel`, `TrustEvidence`, `Attestation`, `TrustRelationship`, `ClaimTrust`) aligning with `07_Trust_Architecture_And_Management.md`.
    *   Correct implementation of the universal trust scale (0-100000).
    *   Good authorization in `update_trust`, `add_trust_evidence`, and `update_claim_trust` (verifying against `relationship.source` or `claim_trust.verifier`).
    *   Trust history tracking (`TrustUpdate`) is excellent for auditability.
    *   Expiration checks are implemented for trust updates and verification.
*   **Critical Issues & Improvements**:
    1.  **CRITICAL - Placeholder `get_direct_trust`**: This core query function is a non-functional placeholder. **Must be implemented** for on-chain trust verification.
    2.  **CRITICAL - Missing Authorization in `establish_trust`**: Must verify that `sender` controls `source_identity`.
    3.  **CRITICAL - Missing Authorization in `establish_claim_trust` & `add_claim_attestation`**: Must verify `sender` controls `verifier_identity` and `attestor_identity` respectively.
    4.  **Missing Transitive Trust Logic**: Functionality for trust path calculation and aggregation (implied by `transferable` and `max_path_length` fields) is not implemented. This is a significant feature gap if on-chain transitive trust is required.
    5.  **Dependency on Functional `identity.move::object_id_to_hex`**: Correct DID generation for sources, targets, and verifiers relies on this.
    6.  **Simplified String Conversions**: `to_string` and `num_to_string` are placeholders. Implement robustly if needed on-chain.
    7.  **Evidence Content Hashing**: Clarify parameter naming for `evidence_content` in `establish_trust` and `add_trust_evidence` (suggest `evidence_content_hash`) as it's directly used as a hash.

### 4.4. `backend/` Service (Rust / Axum)

*   **Purpose**: Provides the main API endpoints for interacting with wot.id features, orchestrating calls to the IOTA L2 (via `iota-sdk`), and communicating with the `identity-service`.
*   **Technology Stack**: Rust, Axum web framework, Tokio asynchronous runtime, `iota-sdk`, `reqwest`, `serde`, `dotenvy`, `tracing`.
*   **Key Files Reviewed**: `Cargo.toml`, `src/main.rs`, `src/identity_client.rs`, `src/health/mod.rs`.

*   **Positive Aspects**:
    *   **Modern Rust Stack**: Utilizes a robust and performant stack suitable for a high-throughput backend.
    *   **Clear Project Structure**: Basic structure with `main.rs`, a client for the `identity-service` (`identity_client.rs`), and a `health` module is logical.
    *   **Comprehensive Health Check (`src/health/mod.rs`)**: 
        *   The `/health` endpoint is well-implemented, checking not only its own status but also critical dependencies: the `identity-service` and the IOTA node.
        *   Provides detailed component status in the JSON response.
        *   Uses timeouts and appropriate methods for checking dependencies (though IOTA node check could leverage `iota-sdk`).
    *   **`identity_client.rs`**: Shows clear separation for `identity-service` communication, aligning with documented architecture (`04_Backend_And_Identity_Service.md`).
    *   Configuration via `.env` files is present.

*   **Critical Issues & Gaps**:
    1.  **CRITICAL - Missing Core API Endpoints & Logic**: 
        *   `src/main.rs` only sets up the `/health` route. None of the primary API endpoints specified in `04_Backend_And_Identity_Service.md` (e.g., for VC issuance, trust management, P2P message relay) are implemented or routed.
        *   This is the most significant gap; the backend currently lacks its core functionality.
    2.  **CRITICAL - Missing IOTA Smart Contract Interaction Logic**: 
        *   There is no visible code utilizing the `iota-sdk` to interact with the Move smart contracts on the IOTA L2 (e.g., constructing Provisional Transaction Blobs (PTBs) for issuing VCs or establishing trust). This is a fundamental requirement for the backend.
    3.  **Rust Edition `2024` in `Cargo.toml`**: The `edition = "2024"` is specified. As of mid-2025, Rust 2024 is very new or potentially a typo for `2021`. If it is indeed `2024`, this is highly experimental and might lead to compatibility issues or reliance on unstable features. **Recommendation**: Verify and likely change to `edition = "2021"` unless there's a specific, compelling reason for `2024`.

*   **Other Areas for Improvement & Consideration**:
    1.  **IOTA Node Health Check via `iota-sdk`**: In `src/health/mod.rs`, the `check_iota_node` function uses `reqwest` for a manual JSON-RPC call. **Recommendation**: Refactor to use the `iota-sdk` (already a dependency) for checking IOTA node status for consistency and to leverage SDK features.
    2.  **`identity_client.rs` - `CreateDidRequest`**: The `CreateDidRequest` struct is currently empty. If it's intended to remain parameterless for `create_did`, this is fine, but it's worth noting it's a minimal implementation.

*   **Alignment with Documentation (`04_Backend_And_Identity_Service.md`)**:
    *   **Aligns on**: Choice of Rust/Tokio, planned use of `iota-sdk`, separation of `identity-service`.
    *   **Major Gaps**: The documented API endpoints and the core business logic involving IOTA smart contract interactions are largely absent from the current code.

*   **Overall Backend Status**: The backend has a good structural foundation and a well-implemented health check. However, it is in an **early stage of development** and requires significant work to implement its core API functionalities and IOTA interactions.

### 4.5. `identity-service/` (Rust / Axum)

*   **Purpose**: Handles DID-specific operations, primarily DID resolution, and a challenge-response mechanism for identity verification, likely for authentication flows. It is designed to be a separate service from the main `backend`.
*   **Technology Stack**: Rust, Axum, Tokio, `identity_iota` (v1.6.0-beta), `iota-sdk` (v0.12.0-rc - from GitHub), `serde`, `uuid`.
*   **Key Files Reviewed**: `Cargo.toml`, `src/main.rs`, `src/handlers.rs`, `src/config.rs`, `src/state.rs`.

*   **Positive Aspects**:
    *   **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Dedicated service for identity operations aligns with good microservice architecture principles and the documented design (`04_Backend_And_Identity_Service.md`).
    *   **Robust Setup**: Well-structured `main.rs` with proper configuration loading (`config.rs`), state management (`state.rs` for `IdentityClientReadOnly`), and Axum server setup.
    *   **Correct DID Resolution & JWS Verification**: The `verify_signature_handler` correctly uses `identity_iota` to parse DIDs, resolve DID documents, and verify JWS signatures against the document using `EdDSAJwsVerifier`.
    *   **Good Error Handling and Logging**: Consistent use of `anyhow` for error context and `tracing` for logging.

*   **Critical Issues & Gaps**:
    1.  **CRITICAL - Placeholder `resolve_email_via_move_contract` in `handlers.rs`**: 
        *   The function `resolve_email_via_move_contract`, which is essential for the `/api/v1/identity/initiate-challenge` endpoint to map an email to a DID, is a **non-functional placeholder**. It contains hardcoded logic and a TODO comment to implement actual Move contract calls.
        *   This renders the challenge initiation flow incomplete and non-operational for most cases.
    2.  **CRITICAL - `iota-sdk` Version Mismatch & Client Capability for Contract Calls**:
        *   `identity-service/Cargo.toml` specifies `iota-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.git", tag = "v0.12.0-rc" }`.
        *   The `backend/` service uses `iota-sdk = "1.1.5"` (a stable, more recent version).
        *   **This version mismatch is a significant risk** and can lead to incompatibilities or subtle bugs when interacting with the IOTA network. **Recommendation**: Align both services to use the same, preferably latest stable, version of `iota-sdk`.
        *   The `IdentityClientReadOnly` (from `identity_iota`) used in `AppState` is designed for DID resolution. It's unclear if it has the capability to *call* Move smart contracts (as intended by `resolve_email_via_move_contract`). Smart contract interactions might require methods from the main `iota-sdk` or a different type of client from `identity_iota` if available. This needs investigation and potential refactoring.
    3.  **Missing DID Creation/Management Logic (If Intended)**: The current handlers focus on DID resolution and a challenge-response flow. If this service is also meant to handle DID *creation* and *management* (publishing DID documents, updates), as might be implied by a dedicated "identity service" and the `CreateDidResponse` in `backend/src/identity_client.rs`, then this functionality is entirely missing.

*   **Other Areas for Improvement & Consideration**:
    1.  **JWS Claim Validation in `verify_signature_handler`**: For enhanced security, validation of JWS claims should include checking `iss` (issuer, should match the `payload.did`) and potentially `aud` (audience) and `exp` (expiration date) if these claims are present and relevant to the security model.
    2.  **Populate `UserInfo` in `VerifySignatureResponse`**: The `UserInfo` struct (containing `email`, `name`) is currently returned with `None` values. If this information can be derived (e.g., from DID attributes or the context of verification), populating it would be beneficial.

*   **Alignment with Documentation (`04_Backend_And_Identity_Service.md`)**:
    *   **Aligns on**: Technology choice (Rust/Axum), separation from the main backend, focus on DID operations.
    *   **Gaps**: The core email-to-DID resolution via Move contract is not implemented. The scope of DID management (creation/updates vs. just resolution/verification) needs clarification against the documentation's intent.

*   **Overall Identity Service Status**: The service has a solid framework for DID resolution and JWS-based signature verification. However, the **critical placeholder for email-to-DID resolution** and the **`iota-sdk` version inconsistency** are major blockers. The service's role regarding DID lifecycle management (creation/updates) also needs to be clarified and implemented if in scope.

### 4.6. `frontend/` (Next.js / TypeScript)

*   **Purpose**: Provides the user interface and user experience for interacting with the wot.id platform.
*   **Technology Stack**: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, `@iota/dapp-kit`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `next-auth`.
*   **Key Files/Directories Reviewed**: `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/AuthSessionProvider.tsx`, `src/app/components/ClientLayout.tsx`, `src/app/components/DappKitProviders.tsx`, `src/app/components/NavBar.tsx`, `src/app/components/Footer.tsx`.

*   **Positive Aspects**:
    *   **Modern Tech Stack**: Utilizes a current and robust stack for web development.
    *   **Well-Structured Providers**: `DappKitProviders.tsx` correctly sets up essential contexts for IOTA client interaction (`IotaClientProvider`), wallet management (`WalletProvider`), client-side data fetching (`QueryClientProvider`), and session management (`SessionProvider` from `next-auth/react`). The IOTA network is correctly configured to point to the local node (`http://localhost:19000`).
    *   **Functional `NavBar`**: The `NavBar.tsx` component successfully integrates `next-auth` for user authentication (sign-in/sign-out) and `@iota/dapp-kit`'s `ConnectButton` for IOTA wallet connections, displaying relevant user/account information.
    *   **Consistent Layout**: `ClientLayout.tsx` ensures a consistent page structure with `NavBar` and `Footer`.
    *   **Dynamic Imports**: Correct use of `next/dynamic` for client-side only components like `DappKitProviders` in `layout.tsx`.

*   **Critical Issues & Gaps**:
    1.  **Non-functional "Connect" Button on Home Page (`page.tsx`)**: The main call-to-action button on the landing page is a simple `Link` component that does not initiate any wallet connection. The actual wallet connection functionality is handled by the `ConnectButton` in the `NavBar`. This creates a confusing and misleading user experience on the home page.
    2.  **Redundant `SessionProvider` Invocation**: `AuthSessionProvider.tsx` is a simple wrapper around `next-auth/react`'s `SessionProvider`. However, `DappKitProviders.tsx` *also* directly includes `SessionProvider`. This results in unnecessary nesting of the `SessionProvider`.
    3.  **Missing Core Application Logic & Backend Integration**: 
        *   Beyond the authentication and wallet connection capabilities provided by the `NavBar`, there is no visible implementation of the core wot.id application features (e.g., UI for DID management, Verifiable Credential issuance/presentation, trust establishment, P2P messaging).
        *   The navigation links in `NavBar.tsx` ("Message", "Transfer", "Trust", "Me") appear to be placeholders for future, unimplemented sections.
        *   There is no evidence of frontend code interacting with the project's backend API services (`backend/` or `identity-service/`) to perform application-specific operations.

*   **Other Areas for Improvement & Consideration**:
    1.  **Consolidate `SessionProvider` Usage**: Remove the `AuthSessionProvider.tsx` wrapper and have `RootLayout.tsx` use `DappKitProviders.tsx` directly, as the latter already correctly includes `SessionProvider`. Alternatively, if `AuthSessionProvider` is intended for future extended logic, ensure it's the sole provider of `SessionProvider` in the tree.
    2.  **Implement Core Features**: This is the most substantial area of future work. It involves building React components for all user-facing identity and trust operations, creating API client logic to communicate with the backend services, and leveraging `@iota/dapp-kit` hooks (e.g., `useIotaClientQuery`, `useSignTransaction`, `useSignAndExecuteTransaction`) for on-chain interactions as per project documentation (MEMORY[82e2aa3e-df8e-4f05-97bf-8b5e2b1655c1]).

*   **Alignment with Documentation (`08_Frontend_And_User_Experience.md`)**:
    *   **Aligns on**: The chosen technology stack (Next.js, TypeScript) and the use of IOTA SDK/DApp Kit for client-side interactions.
    *   **Gaps**: The documentation outlines several advanced frontend functionalities, such as client-side PTB (Power Transaction Block) construction for Move calls, detailed state management approaches, and specific UX flows (e.g., guaranteed human identity verification), which are not yet implemented in the reviewed codebase.

*   **Overall Frontend Status**: The frontend has a solid foundational setup with essential providers for IOTA DApp Kit, React Query, and NextAuth, enabling basic authentication and wallet connectivity. However, it currently lacks the core application-specific UI and logic. The main "Connect" button on the home page is non-functional, and there's a minor redundancy in `SessionProvider` usage. Significant development is required to implement the user-facing features of the wot.id platform and integrate them with the backend services.

## 5. Overall Conclusion

The wot.id project aims to build a comprehensive self-sovereign identity (SSI) and trust platform on IOTA. The code review across its four main components—Move smart contracts, backend service, identity service, and frontend—reveals a project with a strong conceptual foundation and some well-implemented groundwork, but also significant gaps and critical issues that need addressing before it can achieve its objectives.

*   **Move Smart Contracts**: The contracts (`identity.move`, `credentials.move`, `trust.move`) define sophisticated data structures and logic for DIDs, VCs, and a dual trust model, aligning well with wot.id's principles. However, they suffer from critical omissions in authorization checks for creation functions, non-functional placeholder helper utilities (e.g., `object_id_to_hex`, `create_nonce`), and some inconsistencies (e.g., `TrustRelationship` struct duplication).

*   **Backend Service (Rust/Axum)**: The backend has a good basic structure, including a robust health check mechanism. However, it's in an early development stage. Core API endpoints for DID/VC management, trust operations, and P2P messaging are largely missing. Interactions with Move contracts via the IOTA node are not yet implemented. The Rust edition ("2024") is unusual and needs verification, and the IOTA node health check should leverage the `iota-sdk`.

*   **Identity Service (Rust/Axum)**: This service successfully isolates `identity_iota` for DID resolution and JWS verification. However, a critical function for mapping emails to DIDs via Move contracts (`resolve_email_via_move_contract`) is a non-functional placeholder. There's also a significant `iota-sdk` version mismatch between this service (`v0.12.0-rc`) and the backend (`v1.1.5`), which must be resolved. Its role in the full DID lifecycle (creation/management vs. just resolution) needs clarification and implementation if broader.

*   **Frontend (Next.js/TypeScript)**: The frontend has a solid setup with necessary providers for `@iota/dapp-kit`, `@tanstack/react-query`, and `next-auth`, enabling basic authentication and wallet connectivity through a functional `NavBar`. However, the prominent "Connect" button on the home page is non-functional. There's a minor redundancy in `SessionProvider` usage. Most importantly, core application UIs and logic for interacting with wot.id's features (DID/VC management, trust, etc.) and backend services are yet to be developed.

Overall, while individual components show promise, the integration between them is minimal, and key functionalities are either placeholders or entirely missing. Addressing the identified critical issues and implementing the core logic across all layers are essential next steps.

## 6. Overall Recommendations and Prioritized To-Do List

This list synthesizes findings from all reviewed components and prioritizes tasks to move the wot.id project towards a functional, secure, and robust state. Items are grouped by component, then globally, with an attempt at logical sequencing.

**I. Move Smart Contracts (`wot.id/move-contracts/`) - CRITICAL FOUNDATION**

1.  **Implement Missing Authorization Checks (Highest Priority)**:
    *   Add robust authorization checks (e.g., `assert_is_controller`, `assert_is_issuer`) to all creation functions in `identity.move`, `credentials.move`, and `trust.move` (e.g., `issue_credential`, `create_trust_relationship`, `establish_trust`, `add_claim_attestation`). This is crucial for security.
2.  **Implement Placeholder Helper Functions (High Priority)**:
    *   `identity.move`: Implement a robust `object_id_to_hex` function for correct DID generation.
    *   `credentials.move`: Implement `create_nonce` for proof security.
    *   `trust.move`: Implement `get_direct_trust` (if intended for on-chain queries) and improve/replace placeholder string conversion utilities (e.g., `num_to_string`).
3.  **Consolidate `TrustRelationship` Struct (Medium Priority)**:
    *   Resolve the duplication/inconsistency of the `TrustRelationship` struct between `credentials.move` and `trust.move`. Define it in one module (likely `trust.move`) and have the other import it.
4.  **Review and Refine Logic (Medium Priority)**:
    *   Clarify and implement logic for transitive trust pathfinding and aggregation if this is intended to be an on-chain feature. Otherwise, ensure off-chain services are designed for this.
    *   Review all public functions for appropriate visibility and parameter validation.

**II. Identity Service (`wot.id/identity-service/`) - CRITICAL INTEGRATION POINT**

1.  **Resolve `iota-sdk` Version Mismatch (Highest Priority)**:
    *   Update `identity-service/Cargo.toml` to use the same stable version of `iota-sdk` as the `backend/` service (currently `1.1.5`). This may require resolving any breaking changes from `v0.12.0-rc`.
2.  **Implement `resolve_email_via_move_contract` (High Priority)**:
    *   Replace the placeholder logic in `handlers.rs` with actual calls to a Move contract function (e.g., in `identity.move` or a dedicated mapping contract) that resolves an email to a DID.
    *   Verify/implement the client logic for calling Move contracts. `IdentityClientReadOnly` may not be sufficient; direct `iota-sdk` usage might be needed for contract calls (PTB construction).
3.  **Clarify and Implement Full DID Lifecycle Management (Medium Priority)**:
    *   If this service is responsible for DID creation/updates (as implied by `backend`'s `CreateDidResponse`), implement these functions, including interactions with `identity.move`.
4.  **Enhance JWS Verification (Low Priority)**:
    *   Strengthen JWS claim validation in `verify_signature_handler` to include `iss`, `aud`, `exp` as appropriate for the security model.

**III. Backend Service (`wot.id/backend/`) - CORE LOGIC IMPLEMENTATION**

1.  **Implement Core API Endpoints (High Priority - Staged)**:
    *   Start with DID creation, leveraging the (fixed) `identity-service`.
    *   Sequentially implement endpoints for VC issuance/verification, trust management, and P2P message handling stubs, including request/response structures and basic validation.
2.  **Implement Move Contract Interactions (High Priority - Parallel to API Endpoints)**:
    *   Develop logic to construct and submit Power Transaction Blocks (PTBs) to call the deployed Move contracts on the IOTA L2 via the `iota-sdk` for all relevant API operations.
3.  **Refactor IOTA Node Health Check (Medium Priority)**:
    *   Modify `health/mod.rs` to use the `iota-sdk` for checking the IOTA node's health status instead of manual JSON-RPC calls, for consistency and robustness.
4.  **Verify and Correct Rust Edition (Low Priority)**:
    *   Check `Cargo.toml`'s `edition = "2024"`. If it's a typo or not intentionally experimental, change it to a stable edition like `"2021"` and ensure compatibility.

**IV. Frontend (`wot.id/frontend/`) - USER INTERFACE & EXPERIENCE**

1.  **Fix Home Page "Connect" Button (High Priority)**:
    *   Remove the non-functional button from `src/app/page.tsx` or replace it with a functional one that uses `@iota/dapp-kit`'s `ConnectButton` logic (e.g., via `useWallet()` hook).
2.  **Consolidate `SessionProvider` Usage (Medium Priority)**:
    *   Remove `AuthSessionProvider.tsx`. Modify `RootLayout.tsx` to use `DappKitProviders.tsx` directly, as `DappKitProviders` already includes `SessionProvider`.
3.  **Implement Core UI Features & Backend Integration (High Priority - Staged & Ongoing)**:
    *   Develop UI components for basic DID display (once resolvable via backend/identity-service).
    *   Create API client logic to communicate with the backend API endpoints as they become available.
    *   Implement UI for VC display, trust visualization, etc., progressively.
    *   Integrate `@iota/dapp-kit`'s `useIotaClientQuery`, `useSignTransaction`, `useSignAndExecuteTransaction` for client-side interactions with IOTA and Move contracts where appropriate.

**V. Project-Wide & Operational Tasks**

1.  **Tooling for Move Contract Lifecycle (High Priority)**:
    *   Develop/adopt scripts or tools for compiling, deploying, testing, and upgrading Move contracts on the local IOTA node.
2.  **Comprehensive Testing (Ongoing - Start Early)**:
    *   **Unit Tests**: For complex logic in Move contracts, backend, and identity-service.
    *   **Integration Tests**: Crucial for verifying interactions: Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Identity Service ↔ Move Contracts.
    *   **End-to-End Tests**: For key user flows.
    *   Focus on authorization, cryptographic operations, and state consistency.
3.  **Documentation Updates (Ongoing)**:
    *   Keep all project documentation (especially `02_System_Architecture.md`, `04_Backend_And_Identity_Service.md`, `05_WASP_L2_Smart_Contracts.md`, `08_Frontend_And_User_Experience.md`) aligned with code changes and architectural decisions made during implementation.
    *   Document API endpoints as they are finalized.
4.  **Dependency Management & Version Alignment (Ongoing)**:
    *   Regularly review and manage dependencies across all Rust projects (`Cargo.toml`) and the frontend (`package.json`) to ensure compatibility and security.
    *   Maintain strict version alignment for critical shared libraries like `iota-sdk`.
5.  **Security Audits (Future - Plan For)**:
    *   Once core functionalities are stable, plan for internal and potentially external security audits, focusing on Move contract authorization, cryptographic implementations, and overall system integrity.
6.  **CI/CD Pipeline (Medium Priority - For Stability)**:
    *   Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline to automate testing and deployments for all components.

By systematically addressing these points, starting with the critical foundational issues in the Move contracts and `identity-service`, the wot.id project can build momentum and progressively realize its ambitious vision.

## VI. Code Edits

*(2025-06-10T11:26:58+02:00)*

This section details the specific code modifications made during the session to resolve compilation errors and warnings in the Move smart contracts.

### `identity.move`

*   **Restored Necessary Imports**: Re-added `use std::vector;` and `use iota::bcs;` to resolve an `unbound variable` error for `bcs` and a type inference failure for `vector`.
*   **Removed Unused Struct Fields**: Removed the `_attribute_name` and `_disclosure_level` fields from the `AttributePolicy` struct to eliminate unused field warnings. The struct was left with a comment indicating the fields were placeholders.
*   **Removed Redundant Import**: Removed a duplicate `use std::vector;` statement that was causing a compiler warning.

### `credentials.move`

*   **Cleaned Up Imports**: Removed several redundant `use` statements for `std::option`, `iota::object`, `iota::tx_context`, and `iota::transfer` that were causing duplicate alias warnings.

### `trust.move`


*(2025-06-11T08:53:25+02:00) - Security Hardening & Cleanup*

This session focused on a comprehensive security hardening, logic consolidation, and cleanup of all Move contracts.

#### `identity.move`

*   **Implemented Missing Functions**: Added the critical `remove_controller` and `remove_verification_method` entry functions to allow for proper identity lifecycle management.
*   **Enhanced Security**: The new `remove_controller` function includes logic to prevent the removal of the last controller, thus avoiding orphaned identities. Both new functions require controller authorization.
*   **Standardized Error Codes**: Corrected and re-numbered all error codes (`E_NOT_AUTHORIZED`, `E_INVALID_CONTROLLER`, `E_LAST_CONTROLLER`, `E_NOT_FOUND`) to be sequential and non-conflicting.

#### `credentials.move`

*   **Consolidated Trust Logic**: Removed the redundant `TrustRelationship` struct and the `create_trust_relationship` function to centralize all trust-related logic into the `trust.move` contract, creating a single source of truth.
*   **Fixed Helper Functions**: Replaced corrupted placeholder implementations of `create_nonce` and `object_id_to_hex` with functional versions.
*   **Aligned Error Codes**: Updated the `E_NOT_AUTHORIZED` error code to `1` to match the project-wide standard.

#### `trust.move`

*   **Added Critical Authorization**: Implemented missing `identity::assert_is_controller` checks in `establish_trust`, `establish_claim_trust`, and `add_claim_attestation` to ensure only authorized users can perform these sensitive operations.
*   **Resolved File Corruption**: Removed duplicated and corrupted code blocks that were remnants of previous edits, ensuring the file contains clean, single implementations of all functions.
*   **Aligned Error Codes**: Re-numbered error codes (`E_INVALID_TRUST_LEVEL`, `E_INVALID_EVIDENCE`) to prevent conflicts with other contracts.

#### Documentation (`99_Code_Reviews_And_Edits.md`)

*   **Corrected Code Review**: Updated the analysis sections for `identity.move` and `credentials.move` to accurately reflect the current state of the code, acknowledging implemented security checks and re-prioritizing critical issues.

*   **Fixed Mutability Errors**: Corrected multiple `invalid usage of immutable variable` errors by declaring the following variables as `mut` in their respective scopes:
    *   `result` (in `to_string` and `num_to_string`)
    *   `temp`
    *   `digits`
    *   `i` (in both `num_to_string` and `establish_trust`)
    *   `tags`

#### To Do: Rigorous Smart Contract Testing

To ensure the Move smart contracts (`identity.move`, `credentials.move`, `trust.move`) are "bulletproof," a comprehensive testing strategy is required. This involves several layers:

**1. Comprehensive Unit Testing**

This is the foundational step, covering every public and entry function.

*   **General Principles for Unit Tests:**
    *   **Happy Paths:** Verify functions operate as expected with valid inputs and authorized callers.
    *   **Failure Paths (Assertions):** Test for correct reversion with appropriate error codes for authorization failures, invalid inputs, and invalid state conditions.
    *   **Edge Cases:** Test with empty inputs, maximum values, zero values, and other boundary conditions.

*   **Example Test Scenarios:**
    *   **`identity.move`**: Test `create_identity`, `add/remove_controller` (including last controller logic), and `add/remove_verification_method` for all success and failure cases.
    *   **`credentials.move`**: Test `issue_credential` for correct authorization and object creation.
    *   **`trust.move`**: Test `establish/update/add_evidence` for both `TrustRelationship` and `ClaimTrust`, ensuring correct authorization (based on `source_identity`, `verifier_identity`, or `attestor_identity`) and input validation (e.g., `MAX_TRUST_LEVEL`, expiration).

**2. Integration Testing**

*   Test the full lifecycle interaction: Create identities -> Issue credential -> Establish trust in identity -> Establish trust in claim.
*   Test failure propagation across contracts.

**3. Advanced Verification**

*   **Formal Verification:** Mathematically prove critical security properties like the "last controller" rule and the universal enforcement of authorization checks.
*   **Security Audits:** Engage third-party auditors for an external review.
*   **Gas Usage Analysis:** Profile functions to prevent unexpectedly expensive transactions.

This structured testing approach will significantly increase confidence in the security and reliability of the wot.id smart contracts.
