# 01: wot.id - Project Overview and Principles

## 1. Introduction: Human Identity on the Web of Trust

wot.id (Web of Trust Identity) is an open ecosystem for any digitally connected actorâ€”human, machine, or organization. It is built upon IOTA's advanced distributed ledger technology, which is specifically designed for a new economy of data and value. IOTA's unique architecture enables the core features of wot.id: instantaneous and feeless value exchange, secure data transfer, and comprehensive models for digital organization and cooperation.

By leveraging IOTA, wot.id provides the following fundamental capabilities:

*   **Clear Human Identification**: Enables individuals to verifiably identify themselves as human within the digital realm.
*   **True Data Ownership & Control**: Empowers users to own and control all digitalized aspects of their existence.
*   **Value Realization**: Allows individuals to directly receive any value created from their information.
*   **Selective Disclosure**: Provides the means to reveal any aspect of their digital existence to anyone, with any desired degree of anonymity.
*   **Single Source of Truth**: Establishes a reliable, auditable source of truth based on a detailed system of trust relationships.

wot.id implements the principles of self-sovereign identity (SSI) in their truest sense, enabling secure, private, and fully decentralized identity management and interaction, all made possible by the underlying IOTA protocol.

## 2. Core Functionalities

`wot.id` provides a comprehensive suite of features built upon a foundation of self-sovereign identity:

*   **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Management**: Users have full control over their digital identity. They can create, manage, and selectively disclose their identity attributes and credentials with unparalleled privacy and security.
*   **Secure Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Users can engage in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging directly with other users, ensuring conversations remain private and confidential.
*   **Digital Asset Management**: Users can securely store and transfer digital assets peer-to-peer, leveraging the platform's robust security and IOTA's feeless infrastructure.
*   **Decentralized Trust Management**: Users can establish, manage, and verify trust relationships and claims within the network, fostering a transparent and reliable digital ecosystem.

## 3. Guiding Principles

The development and operation of `wot.id` are guided by a set of core and technical design principles.

### 3.1. Core Principles

These 10 fundamental principles guide the `wot.id` ecosystem:

1.  **Open Technological Environment**: An open ecosystem where any actor can participate with minimal friction, minimal costs, and maximal security.
2.  **Strict Peer-to-Peer Environment**: Operates strictly peer-to-peer, excluding intermediaries. Actors connect directly, leveraging DAG technology and liquid governance.
3.  **Guaranteed Human Identity**: Human actors can reliably identify themselves and be unquestionably verified by others.
4.  **Absolute User Control & SSI Ownership**: Each human actor maintains absolute control over their digital identity, aligned explicitly with W3C standards.
5.  **Fair Value Distribution**: Actors own the value derived from their data and are instantly rewarded through microtransactions.
6.  **Decentralized Governance**: Governance processes are fully decentralized, empowering all participants equally.
7.  **Effective Conflict Resolution**: Clear, fair, and decentralized mechanisms are implemented to resolve conflicts efficiently.
8.  **Dynamic Liquidity**: The system is highly liquid and continuously evolving, adapting dynamically based on user behavior and context.
9.  **Intelligent Assistance**: An intelligent assistant capable of making autonomous decisions on behalf of users will be integrated.
10. **Feeless Core Interactions**: Built on IOTA, core data and value transfers are feeless, while smart contract interactions require predictable gas fees. (See: [IOTA Gas Pricing](https://docs.iota.org/about-iota/tokenomics/gas-pricing) and [Gas in IOTA](https://docs.iota.org/about-iota/tokenomics/gas-in-iota))

### 3.2. Technical Design Principles

These 10 technical principles define the implementation approach for `wot.id`, rooted in the capabilities of the IOTA protocol.

1.  **DAG-Based Consensus Architecture**: Utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for processing transactions in parallel. Consensus is achieved via the **Mysticeti** protocol, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm that provides low-latency, high-throughput, and energy-efficient finality. This is a significant evolution from traditional, linear blockchains. (See: [Consensus on IOTA](https://docs.iota.org/about-iota/iota-architecture/consensus)).
2.  **Decentralized Validator Network**: The network is secured by a committee of validators operating under a **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS)** system. Token holders delegate their stake to validators, ensuring that no central authority controls the network. (See: [Consensus on IOTA](https://docs.iota.org/about-iota/iota-architecture/consensus) and [IOTA Proof of Stake](https://docs.iota.org/about-iota/tokenomics/proof-of-stake)).
3.  **Real-Time, Low-Cost Transactions**: IOTA's architecture is designed for high performance, enabling near real-time interactions. While core value transfers are feeless, smart contract execution requires gas, ensuring validators are compensated for computational effort. (See: [IOTA Gas Pricing](https://docs.iota.org/about-iota/tokenomics/gas-pricing) and [Gas in IOTA](https://docs.iota.org/about-iota/tokenomics/gas-in-iota))
4.  **Hybrid Data Storage Strategy**: Employs the IOTA ledger for anchoring identity proofs and value transactions, while leveraging decentralized storage solutions like IPFS for larger, off-chain data payloads.
5.  **Security and Privacy by Design**: Security is anchored by proven cryptography for digital signatures and the robust ownership model of the **Move programming language**, which prevents many common smart contract vulnerabilities at the compiler level. (See: [Security on IOTA](https://docs.iota.org/about-iota/iota-architecture/iota-security) and [Move Concepts](https://docs.iota.org/developer/iota-101/move-overview/)).
6.  **Atomic Data Structure & Modularity**: Implements atomic and independently manageable data fragments for identity and credentials. Identity is not a monolithic profile but is composed of secure, atomic data fragments shared selectively.
7.  **Crypto-Agility & Future-Proof Security**: Prepared for quantum threats with cutting-edge cryptography (PQC-ready by design).
8.  **Device-to-Device Trust & P2P Flows**: Establishes and verifies identity through direct, peer-to-peer attestations and device-to-device flows.
9.  **IOTA-Native and W3C-Compliant**: All on-chain logic is built using IOTA-native technologies, primarily **Move smart contracts** (See: [Move Concepts | IOTA Documentation](https://docs.iota.org/developer/iota-101/move-overview/)), while adhering strictly to W3C standards (DIDs, VCs) for global interoperability.
10. **Universal TrustLevel & Selective Disclosure**: A universal TrustLevel (0.000-100.000) is enforced everywhere. All flows reference and enforce selective disclosure and user sovereignty.

These principles must be referenced and enforced when designing and implementing any aspect of `wot.id`.

## 4. The IOTA Architecture: A Foundation for wot.id

The choice of IOTA as the foundational ledger for wot.id is deliberate and central to its mission. IOTA's unique architecture provides the necessary performance, security, and decentralization required for a global-scale identity system. The key components are detailed below, and all technical decisions must align with this official architecture.

### 4.1. The Core Ledger and Consensus

Unlike traditional blockchains that process transactions sequentially, IOTA uses a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** data structure. This allows for transactions to be processed in parallel, dramatically increasing throughput and scalability. 

Consensus on the order of transactions is achieved through **Mysticeti**, a high-performance Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol. Mysticeti uses the DAG to process blocks in parallel and achieves finality in just three rounds of messages, ensuring extremely low latency. The entire system is secured by a decentralized **Consensus Committee** of validators chosen through a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) mechanism, where IOTA token holders delegate their voting power.

*Reference: [Consensus on IOTA](https://docs.iota.org/about-iota/iota-architecture/consensus)*

### 4.2. The Transaction Lifecycle

Every transaction on IOTA follows a clear lifecycle, ensuring security and consistency from creation to finality. The key stages are:

1.  **Make Transaction**: A user initiates and signs a transaction with their private key.
2.  **Process Transaction**: The transaction is sent to a full node, which distributes it to validators for initial checks.
3.  **Assemble Certificate**: The client gathers signatures from a supermajority of validators into a transaction certificate.
4.  **Sequence**: The certificate is sent to the DAG-based consensus protocol (Mysticeti), which establishes a final, total order.
5.  **Process Certificate**: Validators execute the transaction based on its final sequence order.
6.  **Assemble Effect Certificate**: After execution, the client can gather responses into an effect certificate, proving finality.
7.  **Checkpoint Certificate**: The network periodically creates checkpoints that record the finalized state of the ledger.

This process ensures that even in a distributed environment with potentially malicious actors, the ledger remains consistent and secure.

*Reference: [Transaction Life Cycle](https://docs.iota.org/about-iota/iota-architecture/transaction-lifecycle)*

### 4.3. Security by Design

IOTA's security model is multi-layered, providing robust protection for user assets and data:

*   **Cryptographic Security**: Access to assets is fundamentally controlled by cryptographic key pairs. A transaction can only be initiated by a valid digital signature.
*   **Smart Contract Security**: IOTA uses the **Move** programming language, which is designed with an object-centric ownership model. This prevents many classes of common bugs and vulnerabilities directly at the language level.
*   **Ledger Security**: The dPoS consensus mechanism, run by a decentralized set of validators, ensures the integrity of the ledger and protects against attacks.
*   **Public Auditability**: All transactions, once finalized, are recorded on the public ledger, providing transparency and the ability for anyone to audit the state of the system.

## 5. Alignment with Broader Standards: Trust over IP (ToIP)

`wot.id` demonstrates a strong philosophical and technical alignment with the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation's principles and architecture, aiming to be a specific instantiation of a digital trust ecosystem within the broader ToIP vision.

Key areas of alignment include:

*   **Dual Stack Model**: `wot.id` has a detailed technology stack and foundational elements for a governance stack, aligning with ToIP's dual-stack (Technology + Governance) emphasis.
*   **Layered Architecture**: The system's components naturally map to ToIP's four-layer model (Support, Spanning, Tasks, Applications).
*   **Shared Core Principles**: `wot.id` strongly resonates with ToIP's emphasis on Decentralization, Interoperability, the End-to-End Principle, and Human-Centricity.
*   **Robust Trust Mechanisms**: `wot.id`'s comprehensive Dual Trust Model and advanced context management are sophisticated implementations of ToIP concepts.

## 6. Conclusion

The `wot.id` project is committed to realizing a truly decentralized, user-centric digital future. By adhering to these foundational principles and leveraging the cutting-edge technology of the IOTA protocol, `wot.id` aims to provide a secure, private, and empowering platform for all its users.
