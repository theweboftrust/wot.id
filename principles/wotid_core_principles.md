# wot.id Core Principles (2025)

1. Open Technological Environment  
// wot.id is an open technological environment where any digitally connected actor can participate with minimal friction, minimal costs, and maximum security. This explicitly includes bots, machines, etc.  
Optimized:  
wot.id is an open technological ecosystem where any digitally connected actor—including humans, bots, and machines—can participate effortlessly, with minimal friction, minimal costs, and maximal security.

2. Strict Peer-to-Peer Environment  
// a strict peer-to-peer environment: no company, no government, no intermediary of any sort, but each actor can connect to others at any time, for any duration, for any purpose (DAG, liquid reign)  
Optimized:  
wot.id operates strictly peer-to-peer, excluding companies, governments, and any intermediaries. Actors directly connect with others freely, at any moment, for any duration, and any purpose, leveraging DAG technology and liquid governance.

3. Guaranteed Human Identity  
// any human actor in the loop can identify himself and can be identified by others as human beyond doubt  
Optimized:  
Human actors can reliably identify themselves and be unquestionably verified as human by others, establishing assured trust within the ecosystem.

4. Absolute User Control  
// each human actor has at all times full control over all aspects of his digital identity, with maximum confidentiality, and can reveal any part of his identity at any time  
Optimized:  
Each human actor maintains absolute control and maximal confidentiality over every aspect of their digital identity, selectively disclosing identity attributes whenever they choose.

5. Self-Sovereign Identity Ownership  
// each human actor owns all aspects of his identity without compromise, following W3C principles, establishing SSI  
Optimized:  
Human actors fully and uncompromisingly own their digital identities, aligned explicitly with W3C standards, fully realizing self-sovereign identity (SSI).

6. Fair Value Distribution  
// each actor will own any value that can be created by or extracted from his data and will be awarded this value in instantaneous microtransactions  
Optimized:  
Actors fully own the value derived from their data and are instantly and automatically rewarded through microtransactions, ensuring fair and immediate value distribution.

7. Decentralized Governance  
Governance processes are fully decentralized, empowering all participants equally to influence decisions transparently and dynamically.

8. Effective Conflict Resolution  
Clear, fair, and decentralized mechanisms are implemented to resolve conflicts efficiently, maintaining trust and community integrity.

9. **Dynamic Liquidity:**  
   The system is highly liquid and continuously evolving, adapting dynamically based on user behavior, context, and situational requirements.

10. **Intelligent Assistance:**  
   An intelligent assistant capable of making autonomous decisions on behalf of users will be integrated, enhancing convenience and efficiency.
