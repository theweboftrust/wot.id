# wot.id Design Principles

- Strict modularity: Every section and module is atomic and independently auditable.
- No monolithic objects: All identity and data are fragments, recomposed only as needed.
- TrustLevel: Universal, 0.000-100.000, enforced everywhere.
- Peer-to-peer, device-to-device flows (QR, multi-sig, attestation)
- No legacy code or DB logic; only IOTA-native and W3C-compliant modules.
- Crypto-agile, PQC-ready by design.
- All flows reference and enforce selective disclosure and user sovereignty.  
# wot.id Technical Design Principles

1. **DAG-Based Architecture (IOTA):**  
   Utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture (IOTA Tangle) instead of blockchain, enabling decentralized scalability without transaction fees.

2. **No Centralized Authority:**  
   Explicitly designed with no centralized authority or intermediary controlling data flow, storage, or user interactions. All data handling, storage, and exchanges are strictly peer-to-peer.

3. **Real-Time, Feeless Transactions:**  
   Ensures instantaneous transactions and interactions, eliminating traditional blockchain limitations of latency, costs, and bottlenecks.

4. **Hybrid Data Storage Strategy:**  
   Employs the IOTA Tangle for transactions and identity proofs, and IPFS for efficient, decentralized document and data storage.

5. **Security and Privacy by Design:**  
   Embeds privacy and security into every architectural choice, enforcing selective disclosure to provide confidentiality and control.

6. **Atomic Data Structure:**  
   Implements atomic and independently manageable data fragments for identity and credentials, enhancing auditability and user control.

7. **Modular Composability:**  
   Promotes modular design, enabling flexible recomposition of components to accommodate evolving requirements and functionalities.

8. **Universal Trust and Identity Verification:**  
   Implements universally quantifiable trust mechanisms and robust identity verification, ensuring authenticity, uniqueness, and accountability of all actors.

9. **Crypto-Agility and Post-Quantum Readiness:**  
   Provides crypto-agile frameworks to swiftly incorporate emerging cryptographic standards, proactively ensuring security against quantum computing threats.

10. **Transparent Audit Trails and Interoperability:**  
   Generates immutable, transparent, and verifiable audit trails for every transaction and data exchange, strictly adhering to global interoperability standards (W3C DID, Verifiable Credentials).
