# wot.id Design Principles

- Strict modularity: Every section and module is atomic and independently auditable.
- No monolithic objects: All identity and data are fragments, recomposed only as needed.
- TrustLevel: Universal, 0.000-100.000, enforced everywhere.
- Peer-to-peer, device-to-device flows (QR, multi-sig, attestation)
- No legacy code or DB logic; only IOTA-native and W3C-compliant modules.
- Crypto-agile, PQC-ready by design.
- All flows reference and enforce selective disclosure and user sovereignty.
