# My Identity on the Web of Trust

Welcome to wot.id, a next-generation digital identity platform that puts you in control. Built on IOTA's advanced distributed ledger technology, wot.id enables secure, private, and fully decentralized identity management without intermediaries or fees.

What makes wot.id different:

- **True Self-Sovereign Identity**: You own and control your identity dataâ€”no companies, no governments, no middlemen.
- **Modular By Design**: Your identity isn't a monolithic profile but composed of secure, atomic data fragments you share selectively.
- **Zero-Fee Interactions**: Built on IOTA's feeless network, all identity operations are free and instant.
- **Future-Proof Security**: Prepared for quantum threats with cutting-edge cryptography.
- **Device-to-Device Trust**: Establish and verify identity through direct, peer-to-peer attestations.

## Technology Stack
- IOTA rebased node with Move smart contracts
- Modern React/Next.js frontend for seamless user experience
- Rust-powered backend for maximum security and performance
- W3C standards compliance for global interoperability
