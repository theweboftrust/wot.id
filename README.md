# Human Identity on the Web of Trust

wot.id is a digital identity and communication platform that stricly implements the principles of self-sovereign-identity. Built on IOTA's advanced distributed ledger technology, it is open to all digital actors, but enables secure, private, and fully decentralized identity management and peer-to-peer interaction for humans. It does so with instantanous speed, maximum reliablitiy and zero fees.

It is based on the following principles:

- **True Self-Sovereign Identity**: You own and control your identity dataâ€”no companies, no governments, no middlemen.
- **Modular By Design**: Your identity isn't a monolithic profile but composed of secure, atomic data fragments you share selectively.
- **Zero-Fee Interactions**: Built on IOTA's feeless network, all identity operations are free and instant.
- **Future-Proof Security**: Prepared for quantum threats with cutting-edge cryptography.
- **Device-to-Device Trust**: Establish and verify identity through direct, peer-to-peer attestations.

## Technology Stack
- IOTA rebased node with Move smart contracts
- Modern React/Next.js frontend for seamless user experience
- Rust-powered backend for maximum security and performance
- W3C standards compliance for global interoperability
